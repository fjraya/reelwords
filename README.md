### Notes

I haven't spent much time in first main function. Of course I can do more componetized code 
to get a word from standard input, but I have focused the assestment in the rest of components.


### Compilation

In the project root folder, just type "./gradlew jar"

### Run the application

In the project root folder, just type "java -jar build/libs/reelwords-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar"
